# client-server-model
client-server-model with C

-A demonstration of how socket programming work in C.
-I tried to involve as much pointers as I could to get used to the concept.
-I encountered a few segmentation faults so I had to compile the source code with the -g argument for gcc and had a look at the binary in gdb debugger.
-MALLOC() IS A LIFESAVER!!!!
